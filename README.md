This SQL file is meant to serve as my portfolio. I have downloaded the data from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths. I then cleaned it in Excel and saved two different versions under CovidDeaths and CovidVaccinations which were pulled into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. 

I have explored the data to find out:
the percentage of deaths per population, location, and continent
the number of rolling people vaccinated over time
Percentage_of_Population_Infected
CovidDeathPercentageinIran
CovidDeathPercentageinUSA
Percentage_of_PopVaxed(Population Vaccinated)

In doing the above things, I ran into some errors and google them to see how to fix them. I have commented in the file so that you can understand each step I take.
